# 📘 JavaScript Execution Context — Documentation

## 🔹 What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a **synchronous** and **single-threaded** programming language.
This means it executes **one statement at a time**, in a **specific order**, from top to bottom.

Example:

```js
console.log("Hello JS...");
```

JavaScript will complete this line first, then move to the next line.

## 🔹 What is an Execution Context?

An **Execution Context** is the environment in which JavaScript code is **created and executed**.

You can imagine it as a **big box** that manages:

* Variables
* Functions
* The execution of code

Every time JavaScript runs, it creates an execution context.

---

## 🔹 Parts of an Execution Context

An execution context has **two main components**:

### 1️⃣ Variable Environment (Memory Component)

This is where JavaScript stores:

* Variables
* Functions
* Function arguments

Before the code starts running, JavaScript allocates memory for all variables and functions here.

Example:

```js
let a = 10;
function greet() {
  console.log("Hi");
}
```

In memory:

* `a → undefined`
* `greet → function()`

---

### 2️⃣ Thread of Execution (Code Component)

This is where the **actual code runs**.

JavaScript:

* Reads the code **line by line**
* Executes one line at a time
* Moves to the next line only after finishing the current one

Example:

```js
let a = 10;
console.log(a);
```

Steps:

1. Assigns `10` to `a`
2. Prints `10`

## 🔹 How JavaScript Executes Code

JavaScript follows these steps:

### Step 1: Creation Phase

* Memory is allocated
* Variables are set to `undefined`
* Functions are stored fully

### Step 2: Execution Phase

* Code is executed line by line
* Values are assigned
* Functions are called

---

## 🔹 Why JavaScript is Single-Threaded

JavaScript can do only **one task at a time** because it has:

* One call stack
* One main thread of execution

This makes JavaScript:

* Predictable
* Easier to manage

## 🔹 Summary

| Term                 | Meaning                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Execution Context    | Environment where JS runs      |
| Variable Environment | Stores variables and functions |
| Thread of Execution  | Runs code line by line         |
| Single-threaded      | Executes one task at a time    |
| Synchronous          | Executes in order              |
